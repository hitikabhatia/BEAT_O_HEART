1. INTRODUCTION -
     
     
An IOT - Based Project for prevention of heart attacks .

Every year many peoples die because of heart attack only in United State 375,000 person die every year! there are many drug that        calm down heart and prevent heart attack like nitroglycerin, ACE inhibitors, Beta blockers and ...! but they have to be injected to      the body immediately. When an old lady sleeps at home and suddenly heart attack happens, she is really in a bad situation, because       there is no doctor at home to help her and give her drug and if she is hospitalized, it takes time for nurses to hear the alarm and      go to patient's room, take her drug and inject that to the her body!
So in such a case even a small delay in injecting the drug to the patient’s body can cost a lot more. In such a situation an immediate solution has to be found out to save a life.
      
So, what can be a solution to this ?? …
IoT has got a lot of things in its store to save the human beings from such critical situations.
      
The first stage of heart attack is sudden change in heart beat rate. Suddenly it goes too high or too low. At this stage we detect      it and predict heart attack by help of a microcontroller and a heart rate sensor, then microcontroller will inject drug to body, by     controlling vale or pump that are placed at the middle of drug hose! Now controlling heart attack is faster easier and predictable.


2. Objectives  of  BEAT-O-HEART

      •     Calculation  of  the heart rate of a person.
      •     Capable of controlling the drug injection  ,whenever  the heart rate points at the case of need.
      •     Developing an alternative to the high cost equipment for monitoring heart rate.
      •     The system is capable of saving someone’s life.

The IoT  based heart attack prevention system can be implemented in hospitals, clinics, schools, dispensaries or even at home .In this   system there will be a heart beat sensor module attached with arduino to measure the heart rate of a person in beats per minute (BPM).   Further , a 5V dc stepper  motor will be interfaced along with heart beat sensor to control the injection of the fluid inside  patient’s    body on the basis of the heart rate measured by the sensor and the micro-controller.
